# Linear Regression
A simple Linear Regression with Python

#### Main.py
Shows how to use **LinearRegression.py**

#### LinearRegression.py
Contains the Linear Regression using gradient descent

## How to use
You can pull the repository the way it is. Running **Main.py** calls Linear Regression with the boston dataset. If you just want to use the Linear Regression you have to call `fit()` with a Numpy Array `X` (m_samples, n_features) and a Numpy Array `y` (m_samples).
